### Jupyter Notebook

Run:

```
pip install jupyter
```

For detailed instructions, scripts, and tools to more optimally set up your development environment, check out the [dev-setup](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup) repo.

For more details on notebook installation, follow the directions [here](http://ipython.org/install.html).

More information on IPython/Jupyter Notebooks can be found [here](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

## Running Challenges

### Notebooks

Challenges are provided in the form of **IPython/Jupyter Notebooks** and have been **tested with Python 2.7 and Python 3.x**.

*If you need to install IPython/Jupyter Notebook, see the [Notebook Installation](#notebook-installation) section.*

* This README contains links to [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org), which hosts **static notebooks** of the repo's contents
* To interact with or to modify elements within the **dynamic notebooks**, refer to the instructions below

Run the notebook of challenges:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/portermetrics/jr_coding_challenge.git
$ cd interactive-coding-challenges
$ jupyter notebook
```

This will launch your web browser with the list of challenge categories:

* Navigate to the **Challenge Notebook** you wish to solve
* Run the cells within the challenge notebook (Cell->Run All)
    * This will result in an expected unit test error
* Solve the challenge and verify it passes the unit test
* Check out the accompanying **Solution Notebook** for further discussion
